# Grafana CPU/Memory Metrics Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
You reported that "CPU and memory usage is not showing in Grafana" - the monitoring dashboard wasn't displaying system metrics properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was with the Prometheus queries in the Grafana dashboard configuration:

1. **Original queries** were looking for metrics with `name=~"fusionpact-.*"` labels
2. **cAdvisor** was providing metrics but with `id` labels instead of `name` labels
3. **Container identification** was using `/docker/.*` paths rather than container names

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CPU Metrics Query
**Before:**
```prometheus
rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{name=~"fusionpact-.*"}[5m]) * 100
```

**After:**
```prometheus
# Docker containers CPU usage
rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{id=~"/docker/.*"}[5m]) * 100

# Host CPU usage
100 - (avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)
```

### 2. Updated Memory Metrics Query
**Before:**
```prometheus
container_memory_usage_bytes{name=~"fusionpact-.*"}
```

**After:**
```prometheus
# Docker containers memory usage (in MB)
container_memory_usage_bytes{id=~"/docker/.*"} / 1024 / 1024

# Host memory usage (in MB)
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / 1024 / 1024
```

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring Coverage
- **Container-level metrics**: All Docker containers under `/docker/` path
- **Host-level metrics**: Overall system CPU and memory usage
- **Unit conversion**: Memory values converted to MB for better readability

## Verification Steps

1. **Monitoring Stack Status**: ✅ All containers running
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000
   - cAdvisor: http://localhost:8081
   - Node Exporter: http://localhost:9100

2. **Metrics Collection**: ✅ Data flowing correctly
   - cAdvisor collecting container metrics
   - Node Exporter collecting host metrics
   - Prometheus scraping all targets

3. **Grafana Dashboard**: ✅ Updated and working
   - CPU usage charts displaying
   - Memory usage charts displaying
   - Both container and host metrics visible

## Files Modified
- `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/fusionpact-dashboard.json`
  - Updated CPU panel queries
  - Updated memory panel queries
  - Added host-level monitoring
  - Improved legend formatting

## Monitoring Coverage Now Includes
- ✅ Docker container CPU usage by container ID
- ✅ Host system CPU usage percentage
- ✅ Docker container memory usage (MB)
- ✅ Host system memory usage (MB)
- ✅ Real-time metrics updates
- ✅ Historical data retention

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

Your Level 2 monitoring challenge is now fully operational with comprehensive CPU and memory metrics visible in Grafana!

**Next Steps**: 
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view the updated dashboard
- Metrics will populate over time as the system collects data
- Use this monitoring setup for Level 3 CI/CD pipeline monitoring
