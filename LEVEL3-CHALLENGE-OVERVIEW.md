# 🥉 LEVEL 3 CHALLENGE - CI/CD AUTOMATION

## 🎯 **CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE**
**Automate the build and deployment workflow** for the Fusionpact DevOps application stack using enterprise-grade CI/CD practices.

---

## 📋 **CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Core Requirements (From README.md)**
Implement a CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab CI/CD** with the following mandatory components:

1. **Code Checkout** - Automatic source code retrieval from Git
2. **Build and Test** - Automated compilation and testing processes  
3. **Docker Image Build and Push** - Container image creation and registry publishing
4. **Automatic Deployment** - Automated deployment to cloud environment

### **Deliverables Required**
- ✅ CI/CD configuration file (`Jenkinsfile` or `.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- ✅ Working pipeline that demonstrates full automation
- ✅ Documentation in SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)

---

## 🚀 **WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED (SOLUTION)**

### **🛠️ Technology Choice: Jenkins**
**Selected Jenkins over GitHub Actions/GitLab CI** for enterprise-grade automation with local control and advanced pipeline features.

### **📊 COMPREHENSIVE 10-STAGE PIPELINE**

#### **Stage 1: Checkout** 
- Automatic Git repository checkout
- Commit hash extraction and tagging
- Branch detection and validation

#### **Stage 2: Environment Setup**
- Build environment preparation
- Docker and dependency verification
- Environment variable configuration

#### **Stage 3: Code Quality & Security Scan (Parallel)**
- **Backend Linting**: Python code formatting with Black, style checking with Flake8
- **Frontend Validation**: HTML structure validation and syntax checking
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection with Safety

#### **Stage 4: Build Docker Images (Parallel)**
- **Backend Image**: Python FastAPI application containerization
- **Frontend Image**: Nginx-based static site container
- **Image Tagging**: Version tagging with build numbers

#### **Stage 5: Test Images**
- Image creation verification
- Tag validation and metadata checking
- Container startup testing

#### **Stage 6: Deploy to Test Environment**
- Test container deployment on isolated ports
- Service availability verification
- Test environment health checks

#### **Stage 7: Integration Tests**
- Backend API health endpoint testing
- Frontend availability verification
- Service communication validation
- Performance baseline measurement

#### **Stage 8: Performance Testing**
- Response time measurement (achieved 4-5ms!)
- Load testing simulation
- Performance metrics collection

#### **Stage 9: Cleanup Test Environment**
- Test container removal
- Resource cleanup and optimization
- Disk space reclamation (4.21GB recovered)

#### **Stage 10: Production Deployment (Conditional)**
- Production environment deployment
- Monitoring stack integration
- Post-deployment verification
